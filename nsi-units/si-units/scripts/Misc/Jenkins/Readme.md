The CleanUpJenkinsWorkspace.bat script is used to clean up the Jenkins workspace directories on the build server, as these folders are not currently cleaned up automatically by Jenkins.

The execution of this script is controlled by the Windows Task Scheduler running on the build server.

Instructions for configuring the Task Scheduler to invoke the script are contained here: http://descldwas099v.des.grplnk.net:8090/confluence/display/TEAMVANT/Jenkins+Clean-up
